# carGame
Trying to make a first person car game in javascript with random generated cars.
**************************************
UPDATE AUG 10. 2020:
Game will now be 2d from birds perspective, no longer first person. I managed to make a rect as an example car and multiple rects as road lines, then animating them to make it look like car is driving
**************************************
UPDATE AUG 16. 2020:
Car is now moveable with arrow keys and special easteregg for synne, where if you answer prompt with "ja" you get a pink car. Also made car black by default cause BLM
