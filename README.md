# carGame
Trying to make a first person car game in javascript with random generated cars.
**************************************
UPDATE AUG 10. 2020:
Game will now be 2d from birds perspective, no longer first person. I managed to make a rect as an example car and multiple rects as road lines, then animating them to make it look like car is driving
